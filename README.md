# Burger

## Motivation:  This app was created for burger enthusiasts that would like to keep track of the types of burgers they have eaten.  This app uses express, mysql, handlebars and handmade ORM

## Usage Instructions:  To use this app, users must navigate to where the app is deployed on heroku.  Users are able to use the text box provided on the main page to input a type of burger that they have eaten
or would like to eat.  Once a burger has been entered, the user must hit the submit button to add the burger to the left hand side of the page to indicate the burger has yet to be eaten.  Once the user has eaten
one of the burgers listed in the left hand side, they are then able to hit the devour button, which will move the selected burger to the right side of the page indicating that the burger has been devoured.
Once devoured, burgers must be rentered on the left hand side to be devoured again.
